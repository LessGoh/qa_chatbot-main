![Project image](file:///C:/Users/Dell/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot%20(23).png)




## Project Overview
This project involves building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a Question Answering (QA) bot. The bot retrieves relevant information from uploaded documents using a vector database (like Pinecone) and generates human-like answers using a generative model (such as OpenAI API). Additionally, a frontend interface has been developed using Streamlit/Gradio, allowing users to upload PDFs and ask questions in real-time. The project has been containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) QA bot, which can efficiently answer user queries based on a provided document or dataset. The bot first retrieves relevant segments of the document using a vector database and then generates a coherent answer using a generative model.

The bot is accessible through a user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit/Gradio, where users can upload PDF files and ask questions based on the uploaded content.

### Key Features:
- Retrieval-augmented question answering using Pinecone DB.
- Generation of human-like responses using OpenAI or an alternative generative model.
- Real-time user interaction through an intuitive web interface.
- Ability to handle multiple queries efficiently.

## 2. Architecture Overview <a name="architecture-overview"></a>
The RAG-based QA system is divided into three main parts:

- **Model Architecture**:
  
- Document Ingestion ------> 2. Text Preprocessing -----> 3. Document Embedding Creation -------> 4. Vector Storage in Pinecone -----> 5. User Query ------> 6. Query Embedding ------> 7. Embedding Matching in 
  Pinecone --------> 8. Segment Retrieval -------> 9. Response Generation --------> 10. User Interaction via Frontend

- **Backend (QA Pipeline)**:
  - **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: The system reads and processes documents (PDF, text) and extracts content.
  - **Vector Database (Pinecone)**: Stores document embeddings for fast retrieval.
  - **Generative Model (Cohere API)**: Generates human-like answers based on retrieved document segments.

- **Frontend (Interactive Interface)**:
  - Built using Streamlit/Gradio to allow users to upload PDFs and ask questions.
  - Shows both the retrieved segments and the generated answer.

## 3. Setup Instructions <a name="setup-instructions"></a>

### Local Setup <a name="local-setup"></a>
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites:
- Python 3
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Pinecone API account (for vector database)
- OPENAI API account (for generative model)

#### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Annad25/qa_chatbot/rag-qa-bot.git
   cd rag-qa-bot

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure your Pinecone and Cohere API keys:

   ```bash
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key


## Using Google Colab <a name="using-google-colab"></a>
Open the provided Colab notebook from the repository.  
Follow the step-by-step instructions to run the QA pipeline on Colab.  
Test the bot by uploading sample documents and running queries.

## 4. Model Pipeline <a name="model-pipeline"></a>

### Data Preprocessing <a name="data-preprocessing"></a>
Documents (such as PDFs) are first processed and converted into text using libraries like PyPDF2.  
Text is then divided into smaller chunks for embedding creation.

### Document Embeddings <a name="document-embeddings"></a>
Each text chunk is converted into embeddings using a pre-trained model like OpenAI's CLIP or Sentence-BERT.  
These embeddings are then stored in Pinecone's vector database for fast retrieval.

### Retrieval Process <a name="retrieval-process"></a>
When a user asks a question, the query is also converted into an embedding.  
This query embedding is matched against the stored document embeddings in Pinecone to retrieve the most relevant segments.

### Generation Process <a name="generation-process"></a>
The retrieved document segments are sent to the generative model (e.g., openai API).  
The model uses the retrieved data to generate a coherent response to the user's question.

## 5. Frontend Interface <a name="frontend-interface"></a>
The interactive interface allows users to:

- Upload PDFs: Users can upload documents to be processed by the backend.
- Ask Questions: Users can input questions related to the uploaded document.
- View Results: Both the generated answer and the retrieved document segments are displayed.

## 6. Deployment with Docker <a name="deployment-with-docker"></a>

Steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t rag-qa-bot .
    ```

2. Run the Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8501:8501 rag-qa-bot
    ```

Access the application at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## 7. Example Interactions <a name="example-interactions"></a>

- **Example 1:**
  - Question: "What is the capital of France?"
  - Generated Answer: "The capital of France is Paris."
  - Retrieved Segment: "France's capital is Paris, a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, and culture."

- **Example 2:**
  - Question: "Question: "What is the book about?"
  - Generated Answer: "The book is an educational resource on the science of sound, covering topics such as sound wave properties, audibility, applications of sound, and historical context, including Heinrich   
    Hertz's contributions to sound and electromagnetism."
  - Retrieved Segment: "The book discusses the nature of sound waves, their speed, frequency, wavelength, and how sound is perceived. It also covers practical uses like ultrasound in cleaning and defect 
    detection, along with historical contributions to sound science."?"
    
## 8. Challenges and Solutions <a name="challenges-and-solutions"></a>

- **Challenge 1: Efficient Retrieval**
  - **Problem:** Handling large documents efficiently while retrieving relevant segments.
  - **Solution:** We optimized embedding chunk size and used Pinecone's approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search for faster results.

- **Challenge 2: Handling Multiple Queries**
  - **Problem:** Ensuring the system can process multiple queries simultaneously without performance degradation.
  - **Solution:** We used batching techniques and efficient API calls for handling concurrent user requests.

## 9. Future Improvements <a name="future-improvements"></a>
- **Scalability:** Improve the model to handle even larger datasets and support multiple file types (e.g., Word documents).
- **Enhanced Answer Generation:** Fine-tune the generative model for more complex questions.
- **User Authentication:** Add authentication for personalized document uploads and question history.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
This project demonstrates a robust QA bot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). By integrating Pinecone for document retrieval and OpenAI for response generation, the bot provides accurate and coherent answers in real-time. The interactive frontend allows users to easily upload documents and engage with the bot, making it a useful tool for answering document-based questions.
